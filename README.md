# sql-projects

This SQL query is designed to analyze user behavior and engagement based on account and email activity. It calculates key metrics such as the number of created accounts, sent emails, opened emails, and clicks, segmented by important dimensions:

**Date** — account creation date for accounts, email sending date for emails
**Country** — user location
**Send interval** — the interval set by the account for sending emails
**Account verification** — whether the account is verified
**Subscription status** — whether the user unsubscribed

The query also computes additional metrics, including total accounts and total sent emails per country, as well as country rankings based on these totals.
